Getting Started
===============

The ``climate`` package is a set of tools for managing command-line scripts in a
slightly less cumbersome way than using vanilla Python. The package works with
both Python2 and Python3. It includes several "neato" tools for working with
logging output, and other "neato" tools for working with command-line arguments.

Installation
============

It's easiest to install the ``climate`` package using ``pip``::

  pip install climate

The command will automatically install all dependencies (currently this is just
``plac``).
